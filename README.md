# MCT Daemon

This is the tool for log catching and writing between MCT subcriber and MCT publisher.
MCT subcriber acts as a log consumer, and it consumes logs generated by MCT publisher.
## Overview

- A **MCT Publisher** makes use of MCT Library by utilizing the API provided and
generates logs as a log generator.
- The **MCT Library** provides API for MCT Publisher
- The **MCT Daemon** is the MCT interface for communication between Publisher
and Subcriber. It collects logs generated by Publisher and buffers them upon
Subcriber's request. MCT Daemon also accepts control messages from Subcriber to
adjust Daemon configuration or configure Publisher's behaviors.
- A **MCT Subcriber** fetches logs from MCT Daemon and consumes logs. It could send
some control messages for configuration or trigger features (log catcher).

## Get Started

Follow this link to know how to [install and build](#install-and-build)
MCT Daemon and [run a MCT demo](#mct-demo) if you like, whatever :v

### Install and build

You need to install cmake for the build

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

Then proceed to download/clone MCT if you haven't already.

```bash
